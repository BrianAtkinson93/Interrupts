# Interupts

## What is an interupt?
An interrupt is a signal sent from either hardware or software indicating that some event needs immediate attention. The signal then "interrupts" the current process, saves state (switches context), and then executes a function called an interrupt handler, or an interrupt service routine (ISR) to deal with the event.

## Originating Sources
* __Hardware Interrupt__: Hardward interrupts are generated by hardware or physical devices, something like a keyboard, mouse, network card, etc. signaling the need to process data or actions. For example, a keyboard interrupt signals a key press.
* __Software Interrupt__: Software Interrupts are triggered by software through a system call. This happens when software requests a service like reading a file, allocating memory, etc.

## Interrupt Signal
The purpose of an interrupt signal is to notify the CPU of a high-priority condition requiring immediate attention. Once the CPU finishes executing the current instruction, it saves the current state. This saved state includes information necessary to allow the CPU to resume its previous activity without loss of data or functionality. The CPU then switches context to execute the interrupt service routine (ISR) designated for handling this specific interrupt. After the ISR completes its task, the previously saved state is reloaded, enabling the CPU to continue from exactly where it was interrupted. This process ensures that the system can handle real-time events efficiently while maintaining ongoing tasks seamlessly.
