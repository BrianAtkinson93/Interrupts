# Interupts

## What is an interupt?
An interrupt is a signal sent from either hardware or software indicating that some event needs immediate attention. The signal then "interrupts" the current process, saves state (switches context), and then executes a function called an interrupt handler, or an interrupt service routine (ISR) to deal with the event.

## Originating sources
* __Hardware Interrupt__: Hardward interrupts are generated by hardware or physical devices, something like a keyboard, mouse, network card, etc. signaling the need to process data or actions. For example, a keyboard interrupt signals a key press.
* __Software Interrupt__: Software Interrupts are triggered by software through a system call. This happens when software requests a service like reading a file, allocating memory, etc.
