# Interupts

## What is an interupt?
An interrupt is a signal sent from either hardware or software indicating that some event needs immediate attention. The signal then "interrupts" the current process, saves state (switches context), and then executes a function called an interrupt handler, or an interrupt service routine (ISR) to deal with the event.
